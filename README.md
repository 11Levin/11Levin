## About Me
Hi, I'm Levin Wu. UNC 2028, Major computer science. I graduated from Green Hope High School in 2024, currently part of the Marching Tarheels as a keytar and planning a project to bring a simple card game into a digital game.

## Skills
Swimming and coding but I have yet to learn how to do both at the same time. Also can play the piano.

### Classes
Currently taking COMP 210 and COMP 290, learned how to use Docker and Git in 290, and currently learning more about Java and algorithms in Comp 210. 

### Tools and Programming Languages
I mostly Code in python, but I also know java quite decently, with experience in javascript and HTML. Also, know my way around Git and Docker.
